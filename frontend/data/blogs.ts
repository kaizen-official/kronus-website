Buyers had no standardised complaint mechanism. RERA changed this by creating state-level regulatory authorities with the power to penalise, de-register, and even imprison non-compliant builders.

The kitchen in the southeast aligns with the direction of maximum solar heat gain, keeping cooking spaces warm naturally. The master bedroom in the southwest, away from the afternoon sun, stays cooler. These aren't arbitrary rules — they're observations about climate, light, and airflow codified into a design system before the word 'architecture' existed.",

At Kronus, our design team approaches Vastu as a set of guiding principles rather than rigid commandments. We optimise for natural light and cross-ventilation first, then map the layout to Vastu directional preferences. The result: homes that feel intuitively comfortable, even if you've never heard of Vastu.",

Keep the northeast corner of your home clutter-free and well-lit — this area benefits from morning sun and good ventilation. Avoid placing mirrors opposite the bed (they reflect light and can disturb sleep). Ensure your main door opens inward and clockwise — this is less about energy and more about creating a welcoming, spacious entry. Plants in the east or north enhance air quality where light is abundant. These are sensible design choices dressed in traditional language.",

Our recommendation: in a rising interest rate environment, lock in a fixed rate for the first 3–5 years. In a falling rate environment, go floating from day one. As of 2025, the RBI repo rate is relatively stable, making floating rates the more popular choice at 8.5–9% for salaried borrowers.",

By increasing tenure to 25 years, EMI drops to ₹41,400 but total interest paid jumps to ₹74 lakh. The sweet spot for most borrowers is 15–20 years.

                heading: "What Is RCC and Why Should You Care?",
                body: "RCC stands for Reinforced Cement Concrete — a composite of concrete (cement, sand, aggregate, water) and steel reinforcement bars (rebar). The concrete handles compression (pushing forces), while the steel handles tension (pulling forces). Together, they create a structural system that resists earthquakes, wind loads, and the weight of the building itself. Why does this matter to you? Because load-bearing brick construction — still common in many parts of Haryana — has a structural lifespan of 30–40 years. A well-built RCC frame lasts 75–100 years. Your grandchildren will inherit the structure, not just the property papers.",

                heading: "The 40-Point Quality Checklist",
                body: "At Kronus, every floor of every building passes through 40+ quality checkpoints before the next floor is cast. These include: rebar diameter verification, cover block placement (to prevent corrosion), concrete slump testing (for workability), cube testing (for compressive strength at 7 and 28 days), plumb bob checks for column verticality, and waterproofing membrane integrity tests. We use only ISI-certified TMT steel (Fe-500D grade) and OPC-53 grade cement. Every batch of concrete is tested on-site using a calibrated slump cone. If a batch fails, it's rejected — no exceptions, no rework.",

                heading: "Earthquake Resistance: Not Optional in Sonipat",
                body: "Sonipat falls in Seismic Zone IV on the BIS map — the second-highest risk category. This means buildings must be designed to withstand moderate to severe earthquakes. RCC framed structures, when designed per IS 13920 (ductile detailing), perform significantly better than load-bearing structures in seismic events. The key is ductility — the ability to deform without collapsing. Our structural designs include shear walls, proper beam-column joints with 135° hooks, and lap lengths that exceed code minimums by 15%. When the ground shakes, a Kronus building bends. It doesn't break.",

                heading: "What Corners Look Like When They're Cut",
                body: "Low-quality construction isn't always visible. Common shortcuts include: using thinner rebar (8mm instead of 12mm), reducing cement content in concrete (saving ₹50/bag but halving strength), skipping waterproofing in bathrooms and terraces, using river sand instead of manufactured sand (inconsistent grading), and curing concrete for 3 days instead of the mandated 14. These savings amount to maybe ₹200–300 per square foot for the builder — and decades of reduced structural life for the buyer. Ask your builder for material test certificates. If they hesitate, you have your answer.",

                body: "Plots are pure land — no construction, no depreciation, no maintenance. In Sonipat, a 200 sq.yd plot in a gated community costs ₹30–50 lakh depending on location. Historically, land in developing cities appreciates 10–15% annually, outpacing constructed property. Plots also give you the freedom to build what you want, when you want. The downsides: you can't live in a plot immediately, banks offer lower LTV (loan-to-value) ratios for plots (60–70% vs 80–90% for apartments), and you need to monitor the land to prevent encroachment.",

                heading: "The Apartment Advantage",
                body: "Apartments are ready ecosystems. You move in, plug in your appliances, and start living. For end-users — especially young professionals and nuclear families — apartments make more sense. They come with shared amenities (gym, pool, security) that would cost a fortune to build independently. In Sonipat's apartment market, a 3BHK in a premium project costs ₹50–85 lakh. Annual appreciation in good projects is 8–12%. The downside: apartments depreciate structurally over time, monthly maintenance is non-negotiable, and you have limited control over common area decisions.",

                heading: "Return Comparison: 5-Year Outlook",
                body: "Let's model a ₹50 lakh investment in both. A plot purchased at ₹50 lakh in 2025, appreciating at 12% annually, would be worth approximately ₹88 lakh by 2030. An apartment purchased at ₹50 lakh, appreciating at 9% annually (net of maintenance and depreciation), would be worth approximately ₹77 lakh — but would have also generated rental income of ₹12,000–15,000/month (₹7.2–9 lakh over 5 years). Net result: plots win on pure capital gains; apartments win when you factor in rental yield. Your decision depends on whether you need the asset to generate cash flow or simply grow in value.",

                heading: "What Kronus Recommends",
                body: "Honestly? It depends on where you are in life. If you're 28, building savings, and planning to construct in 5–7 years, buy a plot in a gated community — the appreciation will fund a significant chunk of your construction cost. If you're 35 with a family and need a home now, buy an apartment with good construction quality and genuine amenities. And if your budget allows, do both — a plot for wealth creation and an apartment for living. At Kronus, we offer both, and our team can help you build a portfolio that balances growth with livability.",
